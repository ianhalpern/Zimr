Known Issues

  Because of Zimr's complex inter process communication system, the current transfer speeds
  are dampened considerably. This issue is not a result of CPU performance, zimr does
  not make even a tiny dent to CPU usage. It is related to how sockets and file descriptors
  are handled by the linux kernel. The main thing is it works. The speed issue will be address
  soon.

  There have been reports that for big files, the internel IPC socket connections between zimr-proxy
  and zimr-app falter occasionally by zimr-app receiving a "Connection reset by peer" interrupt. The
  cause is unknown but this will cause zimr to kill all open connections and reset.
